# Installation Checklist: Installation and Walking Skeleton

**Purpose**: Validate requirements quality for the Python/uv installer, gmkit init command, and broader project setup aspects
**Created**: 2025-12-19
**Feature**: specs/002-installer-skeleton/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements. Refined with answers: include broader aspects, all risk areas, author validation.
