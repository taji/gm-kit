# Requirements Quality Checklist: PDF Code Pipeline

**Purpose**: Validate clarity, completeness, and consistency of requirements for the code-driven PDF→Markdown pipeline
**Created**: 2026-02-06
**Feature**: /home/todd/Dev/gm-kit/specs/006-code-pdf-pipeline/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are all primary user journeys captured (full pipeline, phase-only runs, heading inference) without missing core flows? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [x] CHK002 Are required pipeline outputs explicitly specified for each run mode (full pipeline vs phase-only)? [Completeness, Spec §Pipeline Outputs]
- [x] CHK003 Are required diagnostic artifacts defined beyond the final Markdown output (per-phase outputs)? [Completeness, Spec §Pipeline Outputs]
- [x] CHK004 Are all dependencies from E4-07e and orchestration handoffs explicitly listed? [Completeness, Spec §Dependencies, Spec §Inherited Modules]
- [x] CHK005 Are all required schema updates called out for font signatures and mapping inputs? [Completeness, Spec §Requirements]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK006 Is “full font signature” unambiguous and consistently defined as family + size + weight + style? [Clarity, Spec §Requirements]
- [x] CHK007 Is “replace stubs” clearly bounded to orchestration phases and not interpreted as implementing agent/user steps? [Clarity, Spec §Stub Replacement Scope]
- [x] CHK008 Are “per-phase outputs” defined with enough specificity to avoid differing interpretations of which artifacts are required? [Clarity, Spec §Pipeline Outputs]
- [x] CHK009 Is the meaning of “known non-fatal anomaly” specific enough to guide requirements and tests? [Clarity, Spec §Terminology: Non-Fatal Anomalies]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK010 Do the requirements and success criteria consistently reference the same scope (code-category steps only, agent/user as integration points)? [Consistency, Spec §Deliverable Scope, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [x] CHK011 Do assumptions about supported PDFs align with the edge cases and test scenarios listed? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK012 Do phase/step ownership expectations align across requirements and plan inputs? [Consistency, Spec §Stub Replacement Scope, Spec §Plan Inputs]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK013 Are success criteria measurable and testable without requiring final “perfect” Markdown output? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [x] CHK014 Is the requirement for regression tests tied to a clear trigger (integration anomaly) and expected response? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009]
- [x] CHK015 Are acceptance scenarios sufficient to test each user story independently? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK016 Are alternate flows defined for running a single phase versus the full pipeline? [Coverage, Spec §Pipeline Outputs]
- [x] CHK017 Are exception/error flows specified for corrupted PDFs or missing phase inputs? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK018 Are recovery/resume scenarios explicitly documented for partial conversions? [Coverage, Spec §Dependencies, Spec §Pipeline Outputs]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK019 Are requirements defined for PDFs with no extractable text (out-of-scope behavior stated)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK020 Are requirements defined for headings that differ only by weight/style (same family, same size)? [Coverage, Spec §Requirements, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK021 Are requirements defined for missing or incomplete TOC entries and the expected fallback behavior? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK022 Are performance expectations quantified (e.g., acceptable runtime for typical PDFs)? [Clarity, Spec §Non-Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK023 Are determinism/stability expectations defined for repeat runs on the same input? [Clarity, Spec §Non-Functional Requirements]
- [x] CHK024 Are resource limits (disk usage, memory) specified or explicitly out of scope? [Clarity, Spec §Non-Functional Requirements]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK025 Are assumptions about text-extractable PDFs explicitly tied to user guidance and error messaging? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK026 Are dependencies on architecture decision logs and error-condition tables explicitly referenced for planning and tests? [Dependency, Spec §Plan Inputs]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK027 Is “per-phase outputs for diagnostics” clearly scoped to which phases and which file types? [Clarity, Spec §Pipeline Outputs]
- [x] CHK028 Are the roles of agent/user steps clearly excluded from E4-07a implementation responsibilities? [Clarity, Spec §Stub Replacement Scope, Spec §Deliverable Scope]
- [x] CHK029 Is a consistent requirement/acceptance ID scheme used throughout (FR/SC/Story) to support traceability? [Traceability, Spec §Requirements, Spec §Success Criteria, Spec §User Scenarios]
