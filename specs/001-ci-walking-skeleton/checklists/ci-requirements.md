# CI Requirements Checklist: CI Pipeline for Walking Skeleton

**Purpose**: Validate CI requirements clarity, completeness, and consistency for reviewer/author use
**Created**: 2026-01-13
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are PR trigger conditions explicitly defined (target branch, event type)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [x] CHK002 Are all quality gates (lint/typecheck/test-unit/test-integration/test-parity) enumerated, including lint, format, and type-check? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]
- [x] CHK003 Are unit and integration test scopes clearly listed? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [x] CHK004 Are supported agents for integration tests explicitly enumerated? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [x] CHK005 Is Linux parity scope defined in terms of generated file outputs? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004, Spec §Clarifications]
- [x] CHK006 Is the pwsh install-and-fail behavior on Linux specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [x] CHK007 Is the CI pass/fail gating requirement explicitly stated? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005]
- [x] CHK008 Is Windows validation explicitly deferred to CD? [Completeness, Spec §Assumptions]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK009 Is “quality gates (lint/typecheck/test-unit/test-integration/test-parity)” defined with unambiguous inclusions/exclusions? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [x] CHK010 Is the parity comparison method described (file selection, expected outputs)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004, Gap]
- [x] CHK011 Is “validate init and hello-gmkit flow” described with specific expected artifacts? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003, Spec §SC-005]
- [x] CHK012 Is the “scripts directly, no agent invocation” constraint explicit and unambiguous? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003]
- [x] CHK013 Is “typical PR” defined or bounded to avoid ambiguous timing expectations? [Ambiguity, Spec §SC-002]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK014 Do user stories and functional requirements align on CI-only scope (no CD)? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK015 Are parity requirements consistent between Clarifications and FR-004? [Consistency, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §FR-004]
- [x] CHK016 Are success criteria aligned with functional requirements for parity and output validation? [Consistency, Spec §FR-004, Spec §SC-004, Spec §SC-005]
- [x] CHK017 Is Windows deferral consistent across assumptions and requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-004]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK018 Are acceptance scenarios measurable and directly tied to PR outcomes? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Story 1]
- [x] CHK019 Do acceptance scenarios cover a failing parity condition? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK020 Are primary CI flows covered for Linux quality gates (lint/typecheck/test-unit/test-integration/test-parity) and parity? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-002, Spec §FR-004]
- [x] CHK021 Are failure scenarios specified for each gate (lint, tests, parity)? [Coverage, Gap]
- [x] CHK022 Are re-run or retry expectations defined for transient CI failures? [Coverage, Gap]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK023 Is behavior defined when pwsh installation fails on Linux? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-004]
- [x] CHK024 Is behavior defined when expected outputs are partially generated? [Edge Case, Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK025 Are CI performance targets measurable and expressed as best-effort guidance? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002]
- [x] CHK026 Are any reliability or uptime expectations for CI articulated (or explicitly out of scope)? [Coverage, Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK027 Are CI platform dependencies explicit and acceptable? [Dependency, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK028 Is CD explicitly out of scope and consistently excluded from requirements? [Scope, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK029 Are any terms like “quality gates (lint/typecheck/test-unit/test-integration/test-parity)” or “validate flow outputs” still ambiguous? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-002, Spec §FR-003]
- [x] CHK030 Are there any conflicting statements about parity behavior or failure conditions? [Conflict, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §FR-004]

## Traceability

- [x] CHK031 Is every functional requirement referenced by at least one acceptance scenario or success criterion? [Traceability, Spec §Requirements, Spec §User Scenarios, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [x] CHK032 Is there a clear mapping from clarifications to updated requirements? [Traceability, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §FR-004]
- [x] CHK033 Are gaps identified where requirements lack measurable acceptance criteria? [Traceability, Gap]
